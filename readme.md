## Project Description: 
A Chrome extension that allows you to save important blocks of text in a convenient spot where they can be easily accessed and shared. 

## Project Objective: 
Users will be able to save text located within another website, simply by highlighting the text and saving it through the extension. Along with the text, the extension will also save the source of the text (URL) so that users can easily revisit it. Workspaces can be created so that a user will be able to organize their collection of texts. These workspaces can also be shared between multiple users.

## Core Features:
- Create and log in to an account
- Save text through browser extension (highlight -> save text)
- Create workspaces to organize 
- Share workspaces with other users
